# PlayKit Kava for iOS

{:.no_toc}

This project is the new client analytics project of Kaltura.

With Kava project, Kaltura real time analytics for live and on-demand video, you'll get historical or near real-time, raw or summarized data Kaltura partners need to truly understand how, when, and where their content is seen and shared by viewers. What keeps viewers watching? When do they lose interest? What do they share? Actionable Analytics ends the guesswork.

With the clear numbers in hand, Kalturaâ€™s partner can build a content and monetization strategy that really works.

## Usage  

To enable the Youbora Stats Plugin on iOS devices for the Kaltura Video Player, add the following line to your Podfile: 

```ruby
pod "PlayKitKava"
```

### Register Plugin

>Note: Our recommandation is to register on AppDelegate, see sample below.

```swift
PlayKitManager.shared.registerPlugin(KavaPlugin.self)
```

### Create a config and load player


```swift
let kavaConfig = KavaPluginConfig.init(partnerId: 1424501 , ks: nil, playbackContext: nil, referrer: nil, customVar1: nil, customVar2: nil, customVar3: nil)
            kavaConfig.playbackType = KavaPluginConfig.PlaybackType.vod
            let pluginConfig = PluginConfig(config: [KavaPlugin.pluginName: kavaConfig])
```

>Note: Only then load player with Plugin Config.

```swift
            self.player = try PlayKitManager.shared.loadPlayer(pluginConfig: pluginConfig)
```
